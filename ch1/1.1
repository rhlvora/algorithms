1) Sorting: list of birthdays, Convex Hull: smallest length of string to wrap around a set of pegs
2) Memory usage
3) Queue: easy to push and pop onto, cannot jump directly to a node, have to scan it fully
4) In the shortest path, the shortest path that hits every point is calculated. In the traveling salesman problem, a path where the traveler has to return to an origin intermittently complicates the problem.
5) For an ecnryption algorithm, only a perfect algorithm, totally free from errors would suffice. A delivery service from a pizza company would want to find a reasonably good route between all of its delivery stops; it wouldn't need to be the best.
